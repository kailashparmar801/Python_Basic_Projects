print(text_upper)

**************************************

7)Convert to Lower case

Write a code to convert all character of given text into lower-case. Store the result in variable text_lower.

PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Answer:- text = "PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE"
        text_lower = text.lower()

8)String Concatenation

Write a Python code to concatenate the strings first_name as Alice and last_name as Brown. 
Don't forget to give a space in between first name and last name. Store the full name in variable full_name.

Answer:- first_name = "Alice"
         last_name = "Brown"
         full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # The " " adds the space

print(full_name)

9)Type Conversion and Arithmetic

Write a Python code to take a float percentage as 85.5, convert it to an integer, and then add 10 to it. 
Store the final output in a variable result.

Answer:- percentage = 85.5
         integer_percentage = int(percentage)  # Convert to integer
         result = integer_percentage + 10

print(result)

10)Multi-line String Representation

Write a Python code to declare a variable student_info and assign it a multi-line string containing the student’s name as Alice, ID is 101, and score is 90.
Print the variable student_info.

Expected outcome:
Name: Alice
ID: 101
Score: 90

Answer:- student_info = """Name: Alice
         ID: 101
         Score: 90"""

print(student_info)

**************************************

11)Boolean Operation

Write a Python code to declare two boolean variables attended_classes as True and submitted_assignment as False. Use the and operator to check if both are True. 
Store the value in variable result.

Answer:- attended_classes = True
         submitted_assignment = False
         result = attended_classes and submitted_assignment

print(result)

**************************************

12)String Indexing and Slicing

Write a Python code to declare a string student_name as Alice. 
Store the first character and the last three characters of the string in variables first_char and last_three_chars respectively.

Answer:- student_name = "Alice"
         first_char = student_name[0]  # Indexing starts from 0
         last_three_chars = student_name[-3:]  # Negative indexing for last characters

print(f"First character: {first_char}")
print(f"Last three characters: {last_three_chars}")

**************************************

13)Reverse a String

Write a Python code to reverse the string student_name as Alice and print the reversed name. Store the result in variable reversed_name.

Answer:- student_name = "Alice"
reversed_name = student_name[::-1]  # Slicing with a step of -1

print(reversed_name)

**************************************

14)Sum of Digits of a Student ID

Write a Python code to calculate the sum of the digits of a student’s ID (student_id = 123). Store the result in variable digit_sum.

Do not use loops to solve the problem.

Answer:- student_id = 123
         digit_sum = 0

# Convert the ID to a string to iterate through the digits
student_id_str = str(student_id)

for digit in student_id_str:
    digit_sum += int(digit)  # Convert each digit back to an integer and add

print(digit_sum)

15)Compute Final Score

Write a Python code to calculate the final score of a student by taking their exam_score as 90 and assignment_score as 40. 
Multiply the exam_score by 0.6 and the assignment_score by 0.4, then add them together. Store the result in variable final_score.

Answer:- exam_score = 90
         assignment_score = 40

final_score = (exam_score * 0.6) + (assignment_score * 0.4)

print(final_score)
