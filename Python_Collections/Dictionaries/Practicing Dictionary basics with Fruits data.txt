In this project, we will be exploring fundamental concepts related to handling dictionaries in Python. We will cover various operations that can be performed on dictionaries, including:

Creating dictionaries
Accessing values in dictionaries
Adding new key-value pairs to dictionaries
Modifying values in dictionaries
Removing key-value pairs from dictionaries
Looping through dictionaries
Nesting dictionaries
Utilizing other methods associated with dictionaries
Let's get started!

Warm Up Activities: Fruits Data
In this section, we will do some warm up activities to get familiar with dictionaries. We will be creating a dictionary called fruits that contains information about different fruits. The keys in the dictionary will be the names of the fruits, and the values are the colors and prices of the fruits.

1
Create a fruits dictionary

Given a variable fruits_data containing information about fruits, your task is to create a dictionary called fruits that mirrors the data in fruits_data. The resulting fruits dictionary should have the following structure:

{
    'apple': {'color': 'red', 'price': 0.99},
    'banana': {'color': 'yellow', 'price': 0.59},
    # Add more fruits here
}
Use the information in fruits_data to populate the fruits dictionary.

Correct
fruits = {}
for fruit in fruits_data:
    name = fruit[0]
    color = fruit[1]
    price = fruit[2]
    fruits[name] = {'color': color, 'price': price}

fruits
A better solution can be in more pythonic way using tuple unpacking:

fruits = {}
for name, color, price in fruits_data:
    fruits[name] = {'color': color, 'price': price}

fruits
2
Create a Dictionary of Colors and Fruits

Building upon the previous activity where we created a dictionary named fruits, your next task is to create a new dictionary called colors. The colors dictionary should retain the same data as fruits, but with a different structure. In the colors dictionary, the keys should represent the colors of the fruits, and the values should be lists containing the names of fruits of that color.

Upon completion, the colors dictionary should resemble the following structure:

{
    'red': ['apple', 'cherry', 'strawberry', 'raspberry'],
    'yellow': ['banana', 'lemon'],
    # Add more colors and associated fruits here
}
Utilize the information from the fruits dictionary to construct the colors dictionary.

Correct
colors = {}

for fruit in fruits:
    name = fruit
    colors.setdefault(fruits[name]['color'], []).append(name)

colors
Another solution using items method:

colors = {}

for name, info in fruits.items():
    colors.setdefault(info['color'], []).append(name)

colors
Or, using get method:

colors = {}

for name in fruits:
    color = fruits[name]['color']
    colors[color] = colors.get(color, []) + [name]

colors
3
Expand the Fruits Dictionary

Your objective is to augment the existing fruits dictionary by adding the following fruits and their associated information:

('cherry', 'red', 1.99)
('lemon', 'yellow', 0.79)
('lime', 'green', 0.69)
Incorporate this new data into the fruits dictionary.

Correct
You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key like this:

fruits['cherry'] = {'color': 'red', 'price': 1.99}
fruits['lemon'] = {'color': 'yellow', 'price': 0.79}
fruits['lime'] = {'color': 'green', 'price': 0.69}
And if you want to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary, you can use the update method like this:

fruits.update({
    'cherry': {'color': 'red', 'price': 1.99},
    'lemon': {'color': 'yellow', 'price': 0.79},
    'lime': {'color': 'green', 'price': 0.69}
})
Other than that, you can also use a for loop to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary like this:

for name, color, price in [
    ('cherry', 'red', 1.99),
    ('lemon', 'yellow', 0.79),
    ('lime', 'green', 0.69)
]:
    fruits[name] = {'color': color, 'price': price}
4
Count the Colors in the 'fruits' Dictionary

Determine the total number of unique colors present in the fruits dictionary. Please submit your answer in the input field below.

Enter your answer as an integer.

7
Correct
# Count different colors of fruits not the number of fruits
colors = set()
for fruit in fruits:
    colors.add(fruits[fruit]['color'])

len(colors)
Another solution using values method:

len(set(fruits[fruit]['color'] for fruit in fruits))
Or, using values method but without comprehension:

colors = set()
for info in fruits.values():
    colors.add(info['color'])

len(colors)
Or, using items method:

colors = set()
for name, info in fruits.items():
    colors.add(info['color'])

len(colors)
5
Determine the Color of 'Mango' in the 'fruits' Dictionary

Find and report the color of the 'mango' fruit in the fruits dictionary. Please enter your answer in the input field below.

Enter your answer as a string. Example: red

orange
Correct
fruits['mango']['color']
6
Quantify the Count of Red Fruits in the 'fruits' Dictionary

Calculate and provide the total count of fruits with the color red in the fruits dictionary. Please input your answer into the designated field below.

Enter your answer as an integer.

4
Correct
count = 0
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruits[fruit]['color'] == 'red':
        count += 1

count
Another solution using values method:

count = 0
for info in fruits.values():
    if info['color'] == 'red':
        count += 1

count
Or, using items method:

count = 0
for name, info in fruits.items():
    if info['color'] == 'red':
        count += 1

count
7
Calculate the Average Price of All Fruits

Determine the average price of all the fruits within the fruits dictionary. Please input your answer in the designated field below.

Enter your answer as a float. Example: 1.99 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

1.68
Correct
total = 0

for fruit in fruits:
    total += fruits[fruit]['price']

total / len(fruits)
Another solution using values method:

total = 0

for info in fruits.values():
    total += info['price']

total / len(fruits)
More with fruits Data
In this section, you will work with the same fruits data as before, but this time our fruits dictionary will be more extensive, containing additional information about each fruit. You will read this data from a JSON file called fruits.json and store it in the fruits variable.

Here is the details of 2 fruits from fruits variable:

{'apple': {'color': 'red',
           'price': 0.99,
           'calories': 52,
           'nutrition': {'vitamin C': 'good',
                         'vitamin A': 'low',
                         'fiber': 'moderate',
                         'sugar': 'moderate'
                       }
           },
 'banana': {'color': 'yellow',
            'price': 0.59,
            'calories': 96,
            'nutrition': {'vitamin C': 'low',
                          'vitamin A': 'low',
                          'fiber': 'good',
                          'sugar': 'high'
                        }
            },
    ...
}
